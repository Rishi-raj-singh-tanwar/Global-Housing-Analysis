# Global-Housing-Analysis
# Global Housing Market Regression Analysis (2014–2025)

This project analyzes global housing market trends across countries like the USA, UK, India, and UAE, focusing on the years 2014 to 2025. The aim is to uncover insights into housing affordability, price movements, and macroeconomic drivers through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.

## Objectives

- Predict the **House Price Index (HPI)**
- Explore the influence of macroeconomic indicators like:
  - Rent Index
  - Affordability Ratio
  - Mortgage Rate
  - Inflation Rate
  - GDP Growth

## Tools & Techniques

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Models Used**: 
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Evaluation & Interpretation

## Output

The final models were evaluated using metrics like R² Score and Mean Squared Error, with **Random Forest** delivering the best performance for predicting housing prices based on macroeconomic indicators.
